# Exercise

Using the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API), create a webapp that:

* Shows **Top Stories** from Hacker News
* Show comments for each story shown
* Provide a way to show only top stories based on the user input, (example: I want to see only the top stories containing the word "android" in the field `title`)

If you don't know what Hacker News is, you can go to [https://news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com) ;-)

## Setup and delivery

Please fork this repo to work on your implementation and make sure your repo is publicly available to us. When you're ready reply to HR providing the link to your repository with proper instructions for us to test your code.

Please write in a short document (`.md` or `.txt`) your main development/design choices and put it in the root folder of the repository. 

## Technical Requirements

- We prefer to use vanilla Javascript and the latest EcmaScript (ES6+) features
- Using libs/frameworks is not forbidden, but we want to see your code, not someone else's
- You can style your app using SASS or pure CSS
- The solution should work in IE11+ and all modern browsers

## Guidelines

- The UI can be as simple or as complex as you wish
- **Focus your work on TOP STORIES endpoint**. Bonus points if you can show us proper code reuse for other endpoints like *jobs, new, ask, etc...*
- We are keen to see how much you think is enough, and how much would go into a Minimum Viable Product.  As a guide, elegant and simple wins over feature rich every time, though extra gold stars are given to people who get excited and do more because they are having fun
- We also consider the extensibility of the code produced.  Well factored code should be relatively easily extended.
- Bonus points for vanilla JavaScript, unit tests, good accessibility, responsive design, well commented code and comprehensive commit history
- If you could show us how to test-drive your solution using TDD, that's a big plus!

Hope it all makes sense, we're looking forward to your solution, **happy coding**! :)
